# Summary
Increasing recent priate activity in the Strait of Hormuz has led to calls for a coalition intervention into the escalating crisis.

Intelligence indicates multiple cells operating out of the islands dotted around the Straits, one such cell targeted for a strike is Sir Abu Nu'Ayr. Lying just 40 miles from Abu Dhabi it's being used as an observation post to coordinate further attacks at sea. 

The green light has been granted for a land assault and has been authorized by the UAE. Fast jets departing Al Dhafra will soften hard targets ahead of a land and air assault by units of the Expeditionary Unit positioned 3m off the coast.
